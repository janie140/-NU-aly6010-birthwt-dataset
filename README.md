#NU-aly6010-birthwt-dataset

The “birthwt” dataset related to risk factors associated with low infant birth weight consists of 10 columns and 189 rows which have 10 numeric variables. 

After using the correlation function to check the whole correlation relationships of the dataset, I decided to choose these variables to make further regression analysis: “bwt” (birth weight in grams), “lwt” (mother's weight in pounds at last menstrual period), and “race” (mother's race (1 = white, 2 = black, 3 = other)).
